  dynamically join topics

## 0.4.4 - 2021-02-07

  cutover to Slipstream in our stack
    - This is a new section in the "Why :gun?" guide
- Added documentation on counting the number of Slipstream connection processes
  to `Slipstream.ConnectionSupervisor`

## 0.4.2 - 2021-02-05

### Fixed

- Added channel config to socket on `Slipstream.connect/2` or
  `Slipstream.connect!/2`
    - this fixes an issue reconnecting when faking a connection through
      `Slipstream.SocketTest.accept_connect/1`

## 0.4.1 - 2021-02-04

### Fixed

- Changed the default behavior of `c:Slipstream.terminate/2` to disconnect
  gracefully with `Slipstream.disconnect/1`

### Added

- Added better documentation on the `c:Slipstream.terminate/2` callback and
  how to disconnect in it to leave a connection gracefully

## 0.4.0 - 2021-02-04

### Added

- Added telemetry support for clients
    - see the telemetry guide for more details

## 0.3.4 - 2021-02-04

### Fixed

- Fixed spelling and grammar mistakes in the implementation guide

## 0.3.3 - 2021-02-04

### Added

- increased documentation around retry mechanisms
- added a page on the choice of `:gun` as the low-level webscket client

## 0.3.2 - 2021-02-03

### Fixed

- Fixed edge case where the remote server shutting down would not emit a
  `ChannelClosed` event
    - this and heartbeats caused the odd `:gun_error` atom from
      [#12](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/slipstream/issues/12)

## 0.3.1 - 2021-02-03

### Fixed

- The telemetry event for message handles in the connection process should now
  correctly publish the `:events` key, not the `:event` key
- The telemetry guide now correctly states that the `:start_state` key holds
  the connection state for handle-style events

### Added

- Published the connection state at the end of the message handle for
  handle-type telemetry events in the connection process
    - this is published in the `:end_state` key

## 0.3.0 - 2021-02-03

### Added

- `:telemetry` events are executed for each message handled by the
  `Slipstream.Connection` process
    - this should aide in debugging in scenarios in which one wants to see the
      full event history of a connection

## 0.2.4 - 2021-02-02

### Fixed

- Emit `ChannelClosed` event on HTTP close from remote websocket server
    - See [#11](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/slipstream/issues/11)

## 0.2.3 - 2021-02-02

### Changed

- docs: the main page now shows the `Slipstream` module
    - frankly, I just want people to see the Basic Usage section as soon as
      possible so they get a taste for the library

## 0.2.2 - 2021-02-01

### Fixed

- The connection now properly disconnects when the server's heartbeat replies
  timeout with requests
    - disconnects for this reason will send have `:heartbeat_timeout` as the
      reason referenced in `c:Slipstream.handle_disconnect/2`

## 0.2.1 - 2021-02-01

### Fixed

- Connection now correctly emits ChannelClosed events for `:gun` events which
  occur when a service's network access is terminated

## 0.2.0 - 2021-02-01

### Added

- Added a testing framework `Slipstream.SocketTest`

## 0.1.4 - 2021-01-31

### Fixed

- Published license to hex

## 0.1.3 - 2021-01-30

### Changed

- Widened dependency on `:gun` from `~> 1.3` to `~> 1.0`
    - as far as I can tell, there aren't any real changes to the websocket
      interface, so any of these versions should be OK

## 0.1.2 - 2021-01-30

### Added

- More documentation
    - including a Basic Usage section with a minimalistic example

## 0.1.1 - 2021-01-30
