## 0.3.0 - 2021-02-03

### Added

- `:telemetry` events are executed for each message handled by the
  `Slipstream.Connection` process
    - this should aide in debugging in scenarios in which one wants to see the
      full event history of a connection

## 0.2.4 - 2021-02-02

### Fixed

- Emit `ChannelClosed` event on HTTP close from remote websocket server
    - See [#11](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/slipstream/issues/11)

## 0.2.3 - 2021-02-02

### Changed

- docs: the main page now shows the `Slipstream` module
    - frankly, I just want people to see the Basic Usage section as soon as
      possible so they get a taste for the library

## 0.2.2 - 2021-02-01

### Fixed

- The connection now properly disconnects when the server's heartbeat replies
  timeout with requests
    - disconnects for this reason will send have `:heartbeat_timeout` as the
      reason referenced in `c:Slipstream.handle_disconnect/2`

## 0.2.1 - 2021-02-01

### Fixed

- Connection now correctly emits ChannelClosed events for `:gun` events which
  occur when a service's network access is terminated

## 0.2.0 - 2021-02-01

### Added

- Added a testing framework `Slipstream.SocketTest`

## 0.1.4 - 2021-01-31

### Fixed

- Published license to hex

## 0.1.3 - 2021-01-30

### Changed

- Widened dependency on `:gun` from `~> 1.3` to `~> 1.0`
    - as far as I can tell, there aren't any real changes to the websocket
      interface, so any of these versions should be OK

## 0.1.2 - 2021-01-30

### Added

- More documentation
    - including a Basic Usage section with a minimalistic example

## 0.1.1 - 2021-01-30

### Removed

- Removed direct dependency on `:telemetry`
    - see #4
