# Examples

Slipstream provides a number of example socket client implementations as both a
tutorial-like guide and a reference for common implementation patterns.

Each of these examples is tested (via `mix test`), so each example is assured to
be in working order by every green check-mark from the CI.

<!--

## Format

Each example is contained in a directory in `./examples` (the current
directory). Each example contains a `README.md` with:

- a description of the example and what it tries to solve
- a step-by-step listing of commits that created the example

In order to use the examples as a tutorial, try reading through each commit
and reproducing the client in an example project.
