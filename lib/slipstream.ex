  @moduledoc """
  A websocket client for Phoenix channels

  Slipstream is a websocket client for connection to `Phoenix.Channel`s.
  Slipstream is a bit different from existing websocket implementations in that:

  - it's backed by `Mint.WebSocket`
  - it has an `await_*` interface for performing actions synchronously
  - smart retry strategies for reconnection and rejoining work out-of-the-box
  - a testing framework for clients
  - high-level and low-level instrumentation with `:telemetry`

  ## Basic Usage

  The intended use for Slipstream is to write asynchronous, callback-oriented
  GenServer-like modules that define socket clients. This approach makes it
  easy to write socket clients that resemble state-machines. A minimalistic
  example usage might be like so:

      defmodule MyApp.MySocketClient do
        @moduledoc \"\"\"
        A socket client for connecting to that other Phoenix server

        Periodically sends pings and asks the other server for its metrics.
        \"\"\"

        use Slipstream,
          restart: :temporary

        require Logger

        @topic "backend-service:money-server"

        def start_link(args) do
          Slipstream.start_link(__MODULE__, args, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def init(config) do
          {:ok, connect!(config), {:continue, :start_ping}}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_continue(:start_ping, socket) do
          timer = :timer.send_interval(1000, self(), :request_metrics)

          {:noreply, assign(socket, :ping_timer, timer)}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_connect(socket) do
          {:ok, join(socket, @topic)}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_join(@topic, _join_response, socket) do
          # an asynchronous push with no reply:
          push(socket, @topic, "hello", %{})

          {:ok, socket}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_info(:request_metrics, socket) do
          # we will asynchronously receive a reply and handle it in the
          # handle_reply/3 implementation below
          {:ok, ref} = push(socket, @topic, "get_metrics", %{format: "json"})

          {:noreply, assign(socket, :metrics_request, ref)}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_reply(ref, metrics, socket) do
          if ref == socket.assigns.metrics_request do
            :ok = MyApp.MetricsPublisher.publish(metrics)
          end

          {:ok, socket}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_message(@topic, event, message, socket) do
          Logger.error(
            "Was not expecting a push from the server. Heard: " <>
              inspect({@topic, event, message})
          )

          {:ok, socket}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_disconnect(_reason, socket) do
          :timer.cancel(socket.assigns.ping_timer)

          {:stop, :normal, socket}
        end
      end

  ## Synchronicity

  Slipstream is designed to work asynchronously by default. Requests such
  as `connect/2`, `join/3`, and `push/4` are asynchronous requests. When
  the remote server replies, the associated callback will be invoked
  (`c:handle_connect/1`, `c:handle_join/3`, and `c:handle_reply/3` in cases
  of success, respectively). For all of these operations, though, you may
  await the outcome of the asynchronous request with `await_*` functions. E.g.

      iex> {:ok, ref} = push(socket, "room:lobby", "msg:new", %{user: 1, msg: "foo"})
      iex> {:ok, %{"created" => true}} = await_reply(ref)

  Note that all `await_*` functions must be called from the slipstream process
  that emitted the request, or else they will timeout.

  While Slipstream provides a rich toolset for synchronicity, the asynchronous,
  callback-based workflow is recommended.

  ## GenServer operations

  Note that Slipstream is in many ways a simple wrapper around a GenServer.
  As such, all GenServer functionality is possible with Slipstream clients,
  such as `Kernel.send/2` or `GenServer.call/3`. For example, assume you have
  a slipstream client written like so:

      defmodule MyClient do
        use Slipstream

        require Logger

        def start_link(args) do
          Slipstream.start_link(__MODULE__, args, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def init(config), do: connect(config)

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_cast(:ping, socket) do
          Logger.info("pong")

          {:noreply, socket}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_info(:hello, socket) do
          Logger.info("hello")

          {:noreply, socket}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_call(:foo, _from, socket) do
          {:reply, {:ok, :bar}, socket}
        end

        ..
      end

  This `MyClient` client is a GenServer, so the following are valid ways to
  interact with `MyClient`:

      iex> GenServer.cast(MyClient, :ping)
      [info] pong
      :ok
      iex> MyClient |> GenServer.whereis |> send(:hello)
      [info] hello
      :hello
      iex> GenServer.call(MyClient, :foo)
      {:ok, :bar}

  ## Retry Mechanisms

  Slipstream emulates the official `phoenix.js` package with its reconnection
  and re-join features. `Slipstream.Configuration` allows configuration of the
  back-off times with the `:reconnect_after_msec` and `:rejoin_after_msec`
  lists, respectively.

  To take advantage of these built-in mechanisms, a client must be written
  in the asynchronous GenServer-like manner and must use the `reconnect/1` and
  `rejoin/3` functions in its `c:Slipstream.handle_disconnect/2` and
  `c:Slipstream.handle_topic_close/3` callbacks, respectively. Note that the
  default implementation of these callbacks invokes these functions, so a client
  which does not explicitly define these callbacks will retry connection and
  joins.

  Take care to handle the `:left` case of `c:Slipstream.handle_topic_close/3`.
  In the case that a client attempts to leave a topic with `leave/2`, the
  callback will be invoked with a `reason` of `:left`. The default
  implementation of `c:Slipstream.handle_topic_close/3` makes this distinction
  and simply no-ops on channel leaves.

      defmodule MyClientWithRetry do
        use Slipstream

        def start_link(config) do
          Slipstream.start_link(__MODULE__, config, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def init(config), do: connect(config)

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_connect(socket) do
          {:ok, join(socket, "rooms:lobby", %{user_id: 1})}
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_disconnect(_reason, socket) do
          case reconnect(socket) do
            {:ok, socket} -> {:ok, socket}
            {:error, reason} -> {:stop, reason, socket}
          end
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def handle_topic_close(topic, _reason, socket) do
          rejoin(socket, topic)
        end

  These references are returned by calls to `push/4` and may be matched on

  for `await_reply/2`.

  ## Synchronicity

  This approach treats the websocket connection as an RPC: some other process
  in the service does a `GenServer.call/3` to the slipstream client process,
  which sends a push to the remote websocket server, waits for a reply
  (synchronously) and then sends that back to the caller. All-in-all, this
  appears completely synchronous for the caller.

      @impl Slipstream
      def handle_call({:new_message, params}, _from, socket) do
        {:ok, ref} = push(socket, "rooms:lobby", "msg:new", params)

        {:reply, await_reply(ref), socket}
      end

  This approach is written in a more asynchronous fashion. An info message
  arriving from any other process triggers the slipstream client to push a
  work message to the remote websocket server. When the remote websocket server
  replies with the result, the slipstream client sends off the result to be
  dealt with else-where. No process in this scenario blocks, so they are all
  capable of receiving other messages while the work is being completed.

      @impl Slipstream
      def handle_info(:do_work, socket) do
        ref = push(socket, "worker_queue:foo", "do_work", %{})

        {:noreply, assign(socket, :work_ref, ref)}
      end

      @impl Slipstream
      def handle_reply(ref, result, %{assigns: %{work_ref: ref}} = socket) do
        IO.inspect(result, label: "work complete!")

        {:ok, socket}

  A reply from a remote server to a push from the client

  Replies may be any of

  - `:ok`
  - `:error`
  - `{:ok, any()}`
  - `{:error, any()}`

  depending on how the remote server's reply is written.

  Note that the empty map is removed in ok and error tuples, so a reply written
  like so on the server-side:

      def handle_in(_event, _params, socket) do
        {:reply, {:ok, %{}}, socket}
      end

  will translate to a reply of `:ok` (and the same for `{:error, %{}}`).

  ## Examples

      # on the Phoenix.Channel (server) side:
      def handle_in(_event, _params, socket) do
        {:reply, {:ok, %{created?: true}}, socket}
      end

  # the family of GenServer-wrapping callbacks

  @doc ~S"""
  Invoked when the slipstream process in started

  Behaves the same as `c:GenServer.init/1`, but the return state must be a
  new `t:Slipstream.Socket.t/0`. Values from `c:init/1` that you'd
  like to keep in state can be stored with `Slipstream.Socket.assign/3`.

  This callback is a good place to request connection with `connect/2`. Note
  that `connect/2` is an asynchronous request for connection. Awaiting
  connection with `await_connect/2` is unwise in many scenarios, however,
  because failure to connect may result in an exit from the process, crashing
  the supervision tree that started the process. If you wish to connect
  synchronously upon init, a better approach could be:

      @impl Slipstream
      def init(_args) do
        config = Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, __MODULE__)
        socket = new_socket() |> assign(:connect_config, config)

        {:ok, socket, {:continue, :connect}}
      end

      @impl Slipstream
      def handle_continue(:connect, socket) do
        {:ok, socket} = connect(socket, socket.assigns.connect_config)

        {:ok, socket} = await_connect(socket)

        {:noreply, socket}
      end

  But a more minimalistic approach that still provides safety in cases of
  configuration validation failures would be:

      defmodule MySocketClient do
        use Slipstream

        def start_link(args) do
          Slipstream.start_link(__MODULE__, args, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        @impl Slipstream
        def init(_args) do
          config = Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, __MODULE__)

          case connect(config) do
            {:ok socket} ->
              {:ok, socket}

            {:error, reason} ->
              Logger.error("Could not start #{__MODULE__} because of " <>
                "validation failure: #{inspect(reason)}")

              :ignore
          end
        end

        ..
      end

  The configuration could be stored in application config:

      # config/<env>.exs
      config :my_app, MySocketClient,
        uri: "ws://example.org/socket/websocket",
        reconnect_after_msec: [200, 500, 1_000, 2_000]

  And in cases where the configuration validation fails, the `MySocketClient`
  process will not crash the application's supervision tree.

  Request reconnection given the last-used connection configuration

  Note that when `reconnect/1` is used to re-connect instead of `connect/2`

  a retry mechanism with backoff. The process will wait an interval between
  reconnection attempts following the list of milliseconds provided in the
  `:reconnect_after_msec` key of configuration passed to `connect/2` (or
  `connect!/2`).

  The `c:handle_disconnect/2` callback will be invoked for each

  does not contain any connection information (which is added to the socket
  with `connect/2` or `connect!/2`), or if the socket is currently connected.
  For a `reconnect/1` call without configuration, the return pattern is
  `{:error, :no_config}`, and for a socket that is already connected, the
  pattern is `{:error, :connected}`.

  A reconnect may be awaited with `await_connect/2`.

  Requests that a topic be joined in the current connection

  Multiple topics may be joined by one Slipstream client, but each topic
  may only be joined once. Despite this, `join/3` may be called on the same
  topic multiple times, but the result will be idempotent. The client will
  not request to join unless it has not yet joined that topic. In cases where
  you wish to begin a new session with a topic, you must first `leave/2` and
  then `join/3` again.

  The request to join will not error-out if the client is not connected to a
  remote server. In that case, the `join/3` function will act as a no-op.

  A join can be awaited in a blocking fashion with `await_join/3`.

  ## Dealing with crashes

  When attempting to re-join a disconnected topic with `rejoin/3`, the

  Requests that a message be pushed on the websocket connection

  A channel has the ability to reply directly to a message, but this reply
  is asynchronous. Handle replies using the `c:handle_reply/3`
  callback or by awaiting them synchronously with `await_reply/2`.

  Although this request to the remote server is asynchronous, the call to the
  transport process to transmit the push is synchronous and will exert
  back-pressure on calls to `push/4`, as `push/4` blocks until the message
  has been sent by the transport.

  If you are pushing especially large messages, you may need to adjust the
  `timeout` argument so that the GenServer call does not exit with `:timeout`.
  The default value is `5_000` msec (5 seconds).

  A phoenix channel may decide to reply to a message sent with `push/2`. In
  order to link push requests to their replies, store the `ref` string returned
  from the call to `push/4` and match on it in `c:handle_reply/3`.

  Declares that a module is a Slipstream socket client

  Slipstream provides a `use Slipstream` macro that behaves similar to
  GenServer's `use GenServer`. This does a few things:

  - a default implementation of `child_spec/1`, which is used to start the
    module as a GenServer. This may be overridden.
  - imports for all documented functions in `Slipstream` and `Slipstream.Socket`
  - a `c:GenServer.handle_info/2` function clause which matches incoming events
    from the connection process and dispatches them to the various Slipstream
    callbacks
  - a `c:GenServer.handle_info/2` function clause which matches Slipstream
    commands. This is used to implement back-off retry mechanisms for
    `reconnect/1` and `rejoin/3`.

  This provides a familiar and sleek interface for the common case of using
  Slipstream: an asynchronous callback-based GenServer module.

  It's not required to use this macro, though. Slipstream can be used in
  synchronous mode (via the `await_*` family of functions).

  ## Options

  Any options passed as the `opts` argument to `__using__/1` are passed along
  to `Supervisor.child_spec/2`, as is done in the default `child_spec/1`
  implementation for GenServer. Most notably, you may control the restart
  strategy of the client with the `:restart` option. See the example below.

  ## Examples

      defmodule MyApp.MySocketClient do
        # one crash/shutdown/exit will permanently terminate the server
        use Slipstream, restart: :temporary

        def start_link(args) do
          Slipstream.start_link(__MODULE__, args)
