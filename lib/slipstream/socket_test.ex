defmodule Slipstream.SocketTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Helper functions and macros for testing Slipstream clients

  This module is something of a correlary to `Phoenix.ChannelTest`. The
  functions and macros in `Phoenix.ChannelTest` emulate client operations:
  functions like `Phoenix.ChannelTest.join/2`, `Phoenix.ChannelTest.push/3`,
  etc.. Functions and macros in this module emulate behavior of the server:
  a `Phoenix.Channel`.

  ## Timing assumptions

  Clients are typically written to assume that the server

  - is up at time of client start-up
  - is always up

  While this is typically (at least mostly) accurate, it is not necessarily
  true in general and will not be true when testing Slipstream clients. In
  particular, Slipstream clients may fail in test-mode under the following
  conditions:

  - the client is started immediately in the application supervision tree
  - it awaits a connection synchronously (with `Slipstream.await_connect/2`)
  - the testing suite takes longer to complete than the timeout given to
    `Slipstream.await_connect/2`

  While a client that uses `Slipstream.await_connect/2` can band-aid over
  these problems with a high enough timeout, clients should be satisfied with
  receiving successful connection events asynchronously. Clients written in
  the asynchronous callback style will not be affected.

  Some implementation-level details are glossed over by this testing framework,
  including that of heartbeat timeouts. If a client sits idle after joining
  for more than 60 seconds, they will not be terminated due to heartbeat
  timeout.

  ## Setting up a test

  Another assumption clients typically make of servers is that clients assume
  there is just _one_ server. A client is not written expecting to hear that it
  has been connected multiple times for one request to `Slipstream.connect/2`.
  As such, tests using this module as a case template should be run
  synchronously.

      defmodule MyApp.MyClientTest do
        use Slipstream.SocketTest

        ..

  By default, this will start a server session for each test that simulates
  the current test process as the websocket server connected to the client.

      test "the client sends a push to the server on join", c do
        accept_connect(MyClient)
      end

  This server does not run a websocket server. Instead the server is
  a conceptual server: you may imagine that in each test, you are have control
  of the remote server and can control the behavior of the server imperatively.

  The `assert_*` and `refute_*` family of macros from this module allow you to
  make assertions about- and match on values from- requests from the client to
  the server. The remaining functions allow you to emulate actions on behalf
  of a hypothetical server.

  ## Timeouts

  The `assert_*` and `refute_*` macros from this module default to ExUnit
  timeouts. See the ExUnit documentation for more details.

  ## Formatting

  Slipstream exports the `assert_*` and `receive_*` macros as valid
  `locals_without_parens` in its formatter config. To be able to use these
  macros without the formatter injecting parentheses, import `:slipstream` in
  your service's formatter config for `:import_deps`:

      [
        inputs: ["mix.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"],
        import_deps: [:slipstream],
        .. # more configuration
      ]

  #
  #   1. do not spawn a connection process with `Slipstream.connect/2`

  Emulates a server telling the client it has connected

  This sets the current process as the current server connected to the client.
  It also adds an `ExUnit.callbacks.on_exit/2` function that disconnects the
  client on exit with reason `:closed_by_test`. To handle this disconnect,
  clients should match on this pattern in `c:Slipstream.handle_disconnect/2`
  and either shutdown (in the case that the test controls the spawning of the
  client, or reconnect, as with `Slipstream.reconnect/1`. The default
  implementation of `c:Slipstream.handle_disconnect/2` reconnects in this case.
